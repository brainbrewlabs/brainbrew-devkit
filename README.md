# brainbrew-devkit

BrainBrew development toolkit — a Claude Code plugin providing agent chains, skills, and automated dev workflows.

## Features

- **10 workflow templates** with pre-configured agent chains
- **AI-powered routing** — Haiku analyzes agent output to pick the next step
- **Flexible flows** — Multiple routes per agent, conditional branching
- **60+ agents** and **60+ skills** across all templates

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
claude plugins install github:brainbrewlabs/brainbrew-devkit

# Or install from local path (for development)
claude plugins install /path/to/brainbrew-devkit/plugin
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Bump a workflow template to your project
/chain-builder bump develop

# Or choose another template
/chain-builder bump devops
/chain-builder bump marketing
```

## Workflow Templates

| Template | Agents | Chain |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **develop** | 22 | planner → plan-reviewer → implementer → code-reviewer → tester → git-manager |
| **devops** | 10 | code-scanner → security-auditor → test-runner → deployer → monitor |
| **marketing** | 6 | researcher → content-writer → editor → seo-optimizer → publisher → analyzer |
| **research** | 5 | topic-researcher → source-gatherer → analyzer → synthesizer → report-writer |
| **docs** | 5 | code-scanner → doc-generator → doc-reviewer → formatter → publisher |
| **support** | 5 | ticket-classifier → router → knowledge-searcher → response-drafter → reviewer |
| **data** | 5 | data-collector → cleaner → analyzer → visualizer → reporter |
| **moderation** | 5 | content-scanner → classifier → flagger → reviewer → actioner |
| **review** | 1 | code-reviewer → END |
| **minimal** | 0 | hooks only (add your own) |

## Flow Config

Each template includes a `flow:` section with AI-powered routing:

```yaml
flow:
  code-reviewer:
    routes:
      tester: "Code approved, ready for testing"
      implementer: "Code has issues, needs fixes"
      security-scan: "Security concerns found"
    decide: |
      If code is APPROVED → "tester"
      If ANY bugs, issues → "implementer"
      If security vulnerabilities → "security-scan"
```

- **routes:** Maps agent names to descriptions (multiple routes allowed)
- **decide:** AI prompt sent to Haiku to pick which route based on output

## Customization

### Create Custom Agent

```bash
# Start with minimal template
/chain-builder bump minimal

# Create a new agent
# Add file: .claude/agents/my-agent.md
```

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Description of what this agent does.
tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - Edit
---

# My Agent

## Responsibilities
1. Task 1
2. Task 2

## Output Format
- Expected output structure
```

### Create Custom Skill

```bash
# Use skill-creator
/skill-creator

# Or manually create: .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: When to trigger this skill.
---

# My Skill

## Steps
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Example commands
\`\`\`
```

### Create Custom Chain

Edit `.claude/chain-config.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - plugin:post-agent.cjs
  SubagentStart:
    - plugin:subagent-start.cjs
  SubagentStop:
    - plugin:subagent-stop.cjs

flow:
  # Your custom chain
  researcher:
    routes:
      writer: "Research complete"

  writer:
    routes:
      reviewer: "Draft complete"
      researcher: "Need more research"
    decide: |
      If draft COMPLETE → "reviewer"
      If needs MORE INFO → "researcher"

  reviewer:
    routes:
      publisher: "Approved"
      writer: "Needs revision"
    decide: |
      If APPROVED → "publisher"
      If REVISION needed → "writer"

  publisher:
    routes:
      END: "Published"
```

### Mix & Match Templates

```bash
# Start with one template
/chain-builder bump develop

# Copy agents from another template manually
cp ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../devops/agents/deployer.md .claude/agents/

# Add to your flow in chain-config.yaml
```

## Directory Structure

```
brainbrew-devkit/
  src/              # TypeScript source
  dist/             # Compiled output
  plugin/           # Distributable Claude Code plugin
    scripts/        # Chain engine (runner, hooks)
    hooks/          # Hook declarations

        devops/     # CI/CD pipeline
        marketing/  # Content marketing
        ...
```

## Development

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev        # Watch mode
```

## Architecture

Hook-driven chain engine:

1. **post-agent.cjs** — Fires after agent completes; reads `decide:` prompt, calls Haiku, picks next agent
2. **subagent-start.cjs** — Injects context when agent spawns
3. **subagent-stop.cjs** — Records output for chain continuity

Flow config is read from `{cwd}/.claude/chain-config.yaml`.
