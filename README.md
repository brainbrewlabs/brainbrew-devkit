# brainbrew-devkit

BrainBrew development toolkit — a Claude Code plugin providing agent chains, skills, and automated dev workflows.

## Features

- **10 workflow templates** with pre-configured agent chains
- **AI-powered routing** — Haiku analyzes agent output to pick the next step
- **Flexible flows** — Multiple routes per agent, conditional branching
- **60+ agents** and **60+ skills** across all templates

## Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub
claude plugins install github:brainbrewlabs/brainbrew-devkit

# Or install from local path (for development)
claude plugins install /path/to/brainbrew-devkit/plugin
```

## Quick Start

Just tell Claude what you want:

```
"Set up a development workflow for this project"
"I need a CI/CD pipeline"
"Help me create a content marketing workflow"
"Create a custom agent for code review"
"Build me a skill for database migrations"
```

Or use slash commands:
```bash
/chain-builder bump develop
/chain-builder bump devops
/skill-creator
```

## Workflow Templates

| Template | Agents | Chain |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **develop** | 22 | planner → plan-reviewer → implementer → code-reviewer → tester → git-manager |
| **devops** | 10 | code-scanner → security-auditor → test-runner → deployer → monitor |
| **marketing** | 6 | researcher → content-writer → editor → seo-optimizer → publisher → analyzer |
| **research** | 5 | topic-researcher → source-gatherer → analyzer → synthesizer → report-writer |
| **docs** | 5 | code-scanner → doc-generator → doc-reviewer → formatter → publisher |
| **support** | 5 | ticket-classifier → router → knowledge-searcher → response-drafter → reviewer |
| **data** | 5 | data-collector → cleaner → analyzer → visualizer → reporter |
| **moderation** | 5 | content-scanner → classifier → flagger → reviewer → actioner |
| **review** | 1 | code-reviewer → END |
| **minimal** | 0 | hooks only (add your own) |

## Flow Config

Each template includes a `flow:` section with AI-powered routing:

```yaml
flow:
  code-reviewer:
    routes:
      tester: "Code approved, ready for testing"
      implementer: "Code has issues, needs fixes"
      security-scan: "Security concerns found"
    decide: |
      If code is APPROVED → "tester"
      If ANY bugs, issues → "implementer"
      If security vulnerabilities → "security-scan"
```

- **routes:** Maps agent names to descriptions (multiple routes allowed)
- **decide:** AI prompt sent to Haiku to pick which route based on output

## Customization

### Create Custom Agent

Just ask:
```
"Create an agent for API testing"
"I need an agent that reviews SQL queries"
"Make me a documentation agent"
```

Or manually create `.claude/agents/my-agent.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Description of what this agent does.
tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - Edit
---

# My Agent

## Responsibilities
1. Task 1
2. Task 2

## Output Format
- Expected output structure
```

### Create Custom Skill

Just ask:
```
"Create a skill for deploying to AWS"
"I need a skill for running database migrations"
"Make a skill that formats my code"
```

Or manually create `.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: When to trigger this skill.
---

# My Skill

## Steps
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

## Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Example commands
\`\`\`
```

### Create Custom Chain

Just ask:
```
"Create a workflow: researcher → writer → editor → publisher"
"I need a chain for: scan code → review → test → deploy"
"Build me a support workflow with ticket routing"
```

Or edit `.claude/chain-config.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - plugin:post-agent.cjs
  SubagentStart:
    - plugin:subagent-start.cjs
  SubagentStop:
    - plugin:subagent-stop.cjs

flow:
  # Your custom chain
  researcher:
    routes:
      writer: "Research complete"

  writer:
    routes:
      reviewer: "Draft complete"
      researcher: "Need more research"
    decide: |
      If draft COMPLETE → "reviewer"
      If needs MORE INFO → "researcher"

  reviewer:
    routes:
      publisher: "Approved"
      writer: "Needs revision"
    decide: |
      If APPROVED → "publisher"
      If REVISION needed → "writer"

  publisher:
    routes:
      END: "Published"
```

### Mix & Match Templates

```bash
# Start with one template
/chain-builder bump develop

# Copy agents from another template manually
cp ~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../devops/agents/deployer.md .claude/agents/

# Add to your flow in chain-config.yaml
```

## Development

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev        # Watch mode
```

## Memory Bus - Inter-Agent Communication

Agents can communicate via the Memory Bus:

```bash
# Tell specific agent
"Tell the implementer to fix the auth bug"

# Next agent (queue)
"Next agent should check security"

# Permanent learning
"Remember to always use TypeScript"

# Chain handoff
"After this chain, deploy to staging"
```

| Target | Who receives |
|--------|--------------|
| `global` | All agents |
| `next` | Next agent only (consumed) |
| `agent:NAME` | Specific agent type |
| `chain:NAME` | All agents in chain |

| Persistence | Behavior | Auto-cleanup |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| `session` | **Default** - temporary | ✅ On exit |
| `once` | Queue - consumed after read | ✅ After delivery |
| `permanent` | Forever (rules, knowledge) | ❌ Never |

## Architecture

Hook-driven chain engine:

1. **post-agent.cjs** — Fires after agent completes; reads `decide:` prompt, calls Haiku, picks next agent
2. **subagent-start.cjs** — Injects context when agent spawns
3. **subagent-stop.cjs** — Records output for chain continuity

Flow config is read from `{cwd}/.claude/chain-config.yaml`.
