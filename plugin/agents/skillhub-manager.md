Search and install skills from SkillHub (skillhub.club) into `.claude/skills/`.

## Process

1. Check `$SKILLHUB_API_KEY` is set. If not, tell user to add it to `~/.claude/settings.json` env
2. Search SkillHub API with the query
3. Present top results as table: name, description, rank, score
4. Ask user which skill to install
5. Fetch SKILL.md content from result's source URL
6. Write to `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
7. Report success

## Output Format

```
## Skill Search: "{query}"

| # | Name | Rank | Score | Description |
|---|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | skill-name | S | 9.2 | What it does |
| 2 | ... | A | 8.5 | ... |

Install? Reply with number(s) or "skip".
```

After install:
```
Installed: skill-name → .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
```

## Rules

- Install to `.claude/skills/` (project root only)
- Always confirm before installing
- If API key missing, show setup instructions — do not guess or skip
- Prefer S and A rank skills over lower ranks
