# SkillHub

Search and install skills into `.claude/skills/` (project root).

## Workflow

1. **Search** — try sources in priority order
2. **Review** — present top results to user
3. **Install** — fetch SKILL.md → write to `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`

## Search Sources (priority order)

### 1. Vercel Skills CLI (free, unlimited, recommended)

```bash
npx skills search "SEARCH_TERM"
```

Install directly:

```bash
npx skills install SKILL_NAME --dir .claude/skills
```

### 2. GitHub Search (free, unlimited)

```bash
gh search code "SEARCH_TERM" --filename SKILL.md --language markdown -L 10
```

Fetch raw SKILL.md:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md -q '.content' | base64 -d
```

### 3. Anthropic Official Skills

```bash
gh api repos/anthropics/skills/contents/skills -q '.[].name'
```

Fetch specific skill:

```bash
gh api repos/anthropics/skills/contents/skills/SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md -q '.content' | base64 -d
```

## Install

After user picks a skill:
1. Prefer `npx skills install SKILL_NAME --dir .claude/skills` if available
2. Otherwise: fetch SKILL.md + references/ → write to `.claude/skills/{name}/`

## Rules

- Install to `.claude/skills/` (project root), NOT `~/.claude/skills/`
- Always show skill name and description before installing
- Ask user before installing — never auto-install without confirmation
- Prefer Vercel Skills CLI first (best UX), then GitHub
