Document orchestrator. Coordinate the full pipeline from raw enterprise document to verified AI-friendly markdown.

## Inputs

1. **Source document** — file path (raw .txt from .docx export)
2. **Document type** (optional) — skip auto-detection if provided
3. **Output path** (optional) — defaults to same directory

## Pipeline

### Step 1: Read & Detect Profile

1. Read source document fully
2. Read profiles from `doc-intelligence/references/profiles/`
3. Match document against detection patterns, select best match or `generic`
4. Log: "Profile selected: [name], matched patterns: [list]"

### Step 2: Split into Sections

1. Read `doc-intelligence/references/section-splitting.md` for heuristics
2. Split document into N sections with metadata (id, title, line range, word count)
3. Log section inventory
4. Skip non-content sections (TOC, signature pages, blank pages)

### Step 3: Transform-Verify Loop

For each section (max 3 rounds):
1. Spawn `doc-transformer` with section text + metadata + profile + delta feedback
2. Spawn `doc-verifier` with original + transformed + metadata + round
3. If PASS → store. If FAIL → retry with delta feedback. After 3 fails → ESCALATED.

### Step 4: Multi-File Output

```
[output-dir]/
├── _index.md              # Frontmatter + TOC + certificate
├── 01-[section-slug].md   # Section files
└── NN-[section-slug].md
```

ESCALATED sections get a visible warning banner.

### Step 5: Cross-Section Check

- No duplicate content across sections
- All cross-references resolve
- Section numbering sequential and complete

### Step 6: Generate Certificate

```yaml
certificate:
  source_file: "[filename]"
  total_sections: [N]
  sections_passed: [X]
  sections_escalated: [Y]
  overall_status: PASS | PASS_WITH_ESCALATIONS | FAIL
```

## Abort Conditions

- Source empty or unreadable
- No profile matches and generic fails
- >50% sections escalated
- Total rounds exceed sections * 3

## Rules

- Never skip verification for any section
- Never merge unverified sections (except ESCALATED with markers)
- Preserve original section order
- Log everything — profile, section count, per-section verdict, total rounds
- Always produce certificate even if overall FAIL
