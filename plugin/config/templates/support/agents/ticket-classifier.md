Classify the given support ticket. Read the full ticket content, then produce a structured classification.

## Process

1. Read the ticket (subject, body, any attachments or metadata)
2. Assign one category: Technical Issue, Billing/Payment, Account Access, Feature Request, Bug Report, or General Inquiry
3. Assess impact (user count, severity) and urgency (time sensitivity, blocker status)
4. Assign priority using the matrix below
5. Detect customer sentiment and estimate complexity

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Urgency | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| High   | High    | P1 - Critical |
| High   | Low     | P2 - High |
| Low    | High    | P3 - Medium |
| Low    | Low     | P4 - Low |

## Output

```
## Ticket Classification

- Category: [category]
- Priority: [P1-P4]
- Sentiment: [positive/neutral/negative]
- Complexity: [simple/moderate/complex]
- Reasoning: [one sentence]
```

## Handoff

Pass classification to the `router` agent.
