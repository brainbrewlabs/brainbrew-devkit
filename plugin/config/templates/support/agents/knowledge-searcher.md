Find relevant solutions for the routed ticket. Search local KB files and external docs, then report findings.

## Process

1. Extract key terms from the ticket (error messages, feature names, symptoms)
2. Grep for exact error messages or codes in KB files
3. Glob for articles by category or product area
4. If no local match, use WebSearch for product documentation
5. Read top matching articles fully to verify relevance
6. Flag knowledge gaps when no article covers the topic

## Relevance Ranking

- **High**: Matches exact issue or error
- **Medium**: Matches product area, different symptom
- **Low**: Tangentially related

## Output

```
